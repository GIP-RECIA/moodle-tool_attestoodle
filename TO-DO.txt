TO-DO:
 * Make every string translatable
 * Auto-loader to avoid require_once() on every pages (seems useless ? class are autoloading 16/03/2018)
 * Make templates for redundant code (such as Error pages, ex. "training id invalid")
 * (Done but to improve) Define the capabilities and use them in the code
 * Code review (useless methods, redundant code, hard coded functions, ...)
 * Modify trainings instanciation to find courses under sub-categories
